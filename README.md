Using Machine Learning to explore exoplanets.

Two models were used to analyze the exoplanet data, Support-Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Both models were applied using the same techniques.  The data was cleaned, preprocessed by scaling , fitted, and used to make predictions with the assigned test data.

The two models performed similarly, with the SVM approach slightly outperforming KNN.

Additionally, both models were followed up with a Grid Search to tune the parameters to find ideal conditions.

Models were saved and stored in this repository.
